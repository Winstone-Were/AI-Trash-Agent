# Waste Sorting AI System
## Overview
This project implements a waste-sorting system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV for camera input, and Arduino integration for motion and LED-based feedback. The system classifies waste into 12 categories and provides visual and physical indicators for detected waste types.
